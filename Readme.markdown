[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bpaquet/node-logstash.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bpaquet/node-logstash)

What is it ?
---

It's a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) implementation of [Logstash](http://logstash.net/).


What to do with node-logstash ?
---

node-logstash is a tool to collect logs on servers. It allow to send its to a central server and to [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) for indexing.

In top of elastic search, you can use a specialized interface like [kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) to dive into your logs.

Why a new implementation ?
---

When I tried logstash, I had some problems. This version should have:

* lower memory footprint
* lower cpu footprint
* faster startup delay

Moreover it's written in NodeJS, which is a perfect language for programs with many IO.

node-logstash is compatible with logstash. You can replace a node-logstash node by a logstash one. The data are formatted in the same way to be compatible with logstash UIs.

How does it works ?
===

The architecture is identical to logstash architecture. You have to instanciates plugins with the node-logstash core. There are three type of modules:

* [inputs plugins](#inputs): where datas come into node-logstash. Examples: file, zeromq transport layer
* [filter plugins](#filters): extract fields from logs, like timestamps. Example: regex plugin
* [outputs plugins](#outputs): where datas leave from node-logstash: Examples: ElasticSearch , zeromq transport layer.


A typical node-logstash deployement contains agents to crawl logs and a log server.

On agent, node-logstash is configured whith inputs plugins to get logs from your software stack, and one output plugin to send logs to log server (eg. zeromq output plugin).

On log server, logs come trough a zeromq input plugin, are processed (fields and timestamps extraction), and send to ElasticSearch.

Future of this project
===

October 25th 2015.

When I started node-logstash, the ecosystem around logstash and ElasticSearch were almost non-existant. In 2015, the siutation is not the same :
* Great ecosystem around ElasticSearch and logstash, FileBeat project
* Logstash is now the only way to push events to ElasticSearch ([deprecation of rivers](https://www.elastic.co/blog/deprecating-rivers))

So, what is the future of node-logstash ?
* as a tool to collect logs on files and send them through network, node-losgstash is still useful with lower size, instant start, lower CPU / Memory footprint (in my tests with logstash 1.5.0). The comparison is different with Lumberjack and FileBeat.
* as log processing tool, it has the same advantages, but the plugin ecosystem is smaller than Logstash.
* as an injection tool in ElasticSearch : ZeroMQ river will soon be unusable ([deprecation of rivers](https://www.elastic.co/blog/deprecating-rivers)). You have to use bulk api to inject data. It should be less efficient than starting an embedded ElasticSearch node, as in the original Logstash.

Current project status
---

Node-logstash is production ready, and used in production. Installation is a classical node project installation, with some scripts for native packaging.

Maintainers : currently I, @bpaquet, am the only maintainer. I will keep dependencies up to date, update the core to follow node version, but I do not have time to add features in the core. See Contributing below.

Weaknesses :
* tests are difficult to maintain, even if they are many and the code coverage is good. Replace vows by mocha is a good way to improve that, but it's a big rework.

What Pull Request (PR) will be merged ?

Add plugin (output, input or filter)
---

Conditions to have a PR merged :

* respect jslint
* provide documentation in /docs
* do not modify core. Modifications allowed :
  * add plugin in ``Readme.md``.
  * add optional dependencies in ``package.json``
* If you provide unit tests, you can write in plugin documentation that the plugin is a plugin core.
* If you do not provide unit tests, please indicate in the documentation : "Status : contributed plugin, maintained by @xxxx. Producion ready.", and indicate your Github login.

You are encouraged to ask to merge plugins without tests, which are not production ready.

Installation
---

### Simple way

Use [prepackaged deb files](https://packager.io/gh/nodelogstashpackager/node-logstash/install).

After install, just add your config files to ``/etc/node-logstash/plugins.conf.d``, and restart node-logstash ``service node-logstash restart``.

To see what options are passed to node-logstash, see [here](packager/Procfile).

To change log level, do ``node-logstash config:set LOG_LEVEL=debug``, and restart node-logstash.

### Manual install

* Install NodeJS, version >= 0.12
* Install build tools
  * Debian based system: `apt-get install build-essential`
  * Centos system: `yum install gcc gcc-c++ make`
* Install zmq dev libraries: This is required to build the [node zeromq module](https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node).
  * Debian based system: `apt-get install libzmq1`. Under recent releases, this package is present in default repositories. On ubuntu lucid, use this [ppa](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/zeromq). On debian squeeze, use [backports](http://backports-master.debian.org/Instructions/).
  * Centos 6: `yum install zeromq zeromq-devel`. Before, you have to add the rpm zeromq repo : `curl http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fengshuo:/zeromq/CentOS_CentOS-6/home:fengshuo:zeromq.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/zeromq.repo`
* Clone repository: `git clone git://github.com/bpaquet/node-logstash.git && cd node-logstash`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`.

The executable is ``bin/node-logstash-agent``

Configuration formats
---

There are two format for configuration. The legacy format use urls. The new one is identical to the [logstash config format](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/configuration.html).

Note : if you are using multiple config files, you can mix formats.

Configuration by url (legacy)
---

A plugin is instanciated by an url. Example: ``input://file:///tmp/toto.log``. This url
instanciate an input file plugin which monitor the file ``/tmp/toto.log``.

The urls can be specified:

* directly on the command line
* in a file (use the ``--config_file`` switch)
* in all files in a directory (use the ``--config_dir`` switch)

Configuration by logstash config files (recommended)
---

Example for an input file
```
input {
  file {
    path => '/tmp/toto.log'
  }
}
```

You can use ``if`` to have an [event dependent configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/event-dependent-configuration.html). See [here for details](docs/common_params.md).
As for urls, config can be specified

* directly on the command line
* in a file (use the ``--config_file`` switch)
* in all files in a directory (use the ``--config_dir`` switch)

Note : the implementation is young, all bugs reports are welcome.
Note : both formats can be mixed.

Command lines params
---

* ``--log_level`` to change the log level (emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, debug)
* ``--log_file`` to redirect log to a log file.
* ``--patterns_directories`` to add some directories (separated by ,), for loading config for regex plugin and grok plugins. Grok patterns files must be located under a ``grok`` subdirectory for each specified directory.
* ``--db_file`` to specify the file to use as database for file inputs (see below)
* ``--http_max_sockets`` to specify the max sockets of [http.globalAgent.maxSockets](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_agent_maxsockets). Default to 100.
* ``--alarm_file`` to specify a file which will be created if node-logstash goes in alarm mode (see below).

Examples
---

Config file for an agent:
```
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/nginx/access.log"
  }
}

output {
  zeromq {
    address => ["tcp://log_server:5555"]
  }
}
```

Config file for log server:
```
input {
  zeromq {
    address => ["tcp://0.0.0.0:5555"]
  }
}

filter {
  regex {
    pattern => http_combined
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    host => localhost
    port => 9200
  }
}
```

Adding your plugins
---

You can add easily add your plugins :

Manually :

* create a directory layout on the path of your choice : ``/var/my_plugins/inputs``, ``/var/my_plugins/outputs``, ``/var/my_plugins/filters``
* set the NODE_PATH variable to ``NODE_PATH=/var/my_plugins:/node_logstash_path/lib``
* add your plugins in ``inputs``, ``outputs`` or ``filters`` directory. In the plugin code, you can reference base plugins with ``var base_filter = require('lib/base_filter');``
* reference your plugin as usual.


With native packaging

The plugins must be deployed in ``/var/db/node-logstash/custom_plugins``. All subdirectories already exists. The NODE_PATH is already set.


Signals
---

* USR1: stoping or starting all inputs plugins. Can be used to close input when output targer are failing
* USR2: see below file output plugin
